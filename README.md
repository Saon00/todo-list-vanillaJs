##Todo-List - JavaScript(vanillaJs)

#### This project is made for checking the working methods of VanillaJs and Others. This Project is made with the help of [Simo Edwin's][1]; [vanilla-todo][2] project.
<p>Here is some demo pictures of this project. And there is a problem I'm facing. The "select" option is not working properly. It'll be pleasure if you try to figure-out where is the problem and help me to solve it.
<br>
It'll store the todo lists in "Local Storage". I'm attaching a picture of that to clarify.</p>
